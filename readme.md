# 📌Cardiac MRI 3D Ejection Fraction Estimation

This project focuses on estimating the Ejection Fraction (EF) from Cardiac MRI images using 3D U-Net and MONAI.

## Project Structure

- `3D/`: Contains 3D models or related data.
- `Plots/`: Includes visualization files for data analysis.
- `dataset/`: Directory for dataset files used in training and evaluation.
- `tb_logs/`: Stores TensorBoard logs for monitoring training performance.
- `preview.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for previewing data or model outputs.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `run.py`: Main script to execute the training or evaluation pipeline.
- `testing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for testing and validating the model.

## 🚀Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fosii/cmr-lvef-estimation.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
